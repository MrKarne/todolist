# todolist

Ever wondered why you always forget things when u note down in a paper? It is because it is difficult carry a paper wherever you go. So, it is better to note down your tasks in Mobile.

You don't have to login. You just have to note down your tasks and save. And it will show you the saved tasks next time you visit the page

This one doesn't have many features. This is minimalistic.

All the best using my simple and useful todo list webpage
